HOW HEIMDALL WORKS

run: heimdall -f [file].fil to generate a candidate (.cand) file

including -v, -V, -g or -G incrementally increases verbosity (tells you what is going on)

at maximum verbosity you can see that heimdall:

1: allocates memory for pipeline computations
2: does 0-dm cleaning
3: dedisperses within your chosen range (default 0-1000.56)
4: copies??
5: Baselines??
6: Normalises??
7: Filters?? (guessing match filtering?)
8: Finds giant pulses
9: Processes candidates (writes them to file?)
